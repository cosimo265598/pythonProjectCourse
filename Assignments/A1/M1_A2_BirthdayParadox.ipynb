    "# The birtday paradox\n",
    "The Birthday Paradox is the surprisingly high probability that two people will have the same birthday even in a small group of people. \n",
    "The term paradox is not the most appropriate term to define the phenomenon, as it is merely something *interesting*, but we are not here to discuss semantics. As an example, it takes a group as small as 23 people to have a 50% chance of a matching birthday. \n",
