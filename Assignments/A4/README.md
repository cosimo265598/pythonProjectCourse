# Module 4 - Assignments
In this repository you can find four assignments you can choose from, dedicated to topics pertaining to the fourth module.

It is mandatory you try to solve at least one, to show active participation to the course.

## Contents
Four assignments of varying degrees of difficulty and with a different focus.
- A1 revisits Conway's Game of Life in a vectorized fashion
- A2 focuses on evaluating functions in the complex plane to visualize the Mandelbrot set
- A3 tackles path-finding in a maze with a novel approach
- A4 consists of a simple case of data analysis on meteorological data

## Additional info
You can solve the assignments directly in the attached notebooks or develop and add/commit additional script files and folders. Feel free to proceed as you deem most appropriate. Since you are dealing with more articulated exercises, it may be beneficial to solve them in a separate module.
It is not mandatory for you to commit your on-going work, but it is helpful having your progress synced in your remote repository in case you need assistance.
You can choose to work in small groups (3-4 people max).
