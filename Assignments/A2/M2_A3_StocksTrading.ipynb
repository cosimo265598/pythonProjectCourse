    "# Titles trading\n",
    "We want to manage a simplified trading market in which we have to keep tracks of stock titles and buy/sell operations.\n",
    "Each stock title is uniquely identified by an alphanumerical code. Each trading operation is characterized by the number of stocks of a given title effectively bought (or sold), the date/time of the operation and the price per stock.\n",
    "We are interested in keeping tracks of all the transactions for each title, the min/max/average stock price for a title in a given date and the overall number of stocks sold of a title in each date.\n",
    "Write a program taking into account the following tasks:\n",
    "- Devise an appropriate way to organize data in memory\n",
    "- Read titles and stock trades either from file or command line\n",
    "- Write a program that supports updating the available information introducing new titles, registering new operations and updating in turn the statistical values collected for each title.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Format example\n",
    "- The Google title is uniquely identified by the id `GOOG`\n",
    "- A trading operations representing a buy operation of a number of Google stocks at a given price at a given moment in time could be represented as `GOOG BUY <num_stocks> <price_per_stock> <YYYY/MM/DD> <HH:mm:ss>` "
