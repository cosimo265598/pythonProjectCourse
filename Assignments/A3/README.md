# Module 3 - Workbooks
In this repository you can find three workbooks dedicated to topics pertaining to the third module.

The exercises proposed in these workbooks are meant to be used as self-paced learning material.

## Contents
You will find three notebooks, in which exercises are split according to topics and overall difficulty:
1. `M3_Workbook_Basics` is a collection of exercises to familiarize with OOP concepts
2. `M3_Workbook_OOP` is a collection of more demanding OOP-oriented exercises
3. `M3_Workbook_Functional` is a collection of exercises focused on functional programming

## Additional info
You can solve the exercises directly in the attached notebooks or develop and add/commit additional script files and folders. Feel free to proceed as you deem most appropriate. OOP exercises may be better suited to be solved in a dedicated module.
It is not mandatory for you to commit your on-going work, but it is helpful having your progress synced in your remote repository in case you need assistance.
