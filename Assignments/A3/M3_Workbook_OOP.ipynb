    "For all the following exercise that start by describing a scenario, it is convenient to tackle each problem step-by-step.\n",
    "Make sure to carefully read the scenario in order to brainstorm it before writing any code. It is convenient to read the whole text at least once, and then restart from the beginning for a more in-depth read. It is important to understand which entities and behaviours may characterize what we want to model and in which way our objects may interact one with one another.\n",

    "A *mixin* is a class designed to be subclassed together with at least one other class in multiple-inheritance arrangement. A mixin is meant to extend or customize the behavior of a child or sibling class but should not provide all the functionality for a concrete object. As a result, a mixin is not supposed to be neither directly instantiate nor used as the sole base class of a concrete class. \n",

The mixin class should redefine the appropriate methods of the `Mapping` and/or `MutableMapping` abstract base classes so that the following tests are passed. [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html) is a good place to find out which methods should be redefined."

    "- Each character can be equipped according to its class, assigning the available equipment items to equipment slots\n",

    "\n",

    "- HP: Number of hit points, representing the constitution of the character\n",

    "- Humans is a well-rounded race with the following base stats distribution: 1250, 100, 25, 25, 20, 20\n",
    "- High-Elves are mostly magic users with a weaker constitution: 500, 300, 5, 40, 5, 50\n",

    "The character class describes the role of a character in the game, e.g., *Warrior* or *Sorcerer* or *Druid*, etc.\n",

    "- The warrior class applies a boost to constitution and physical stats while sacrificing magic: +250, -25, +10, -5, +5, -5\n",
